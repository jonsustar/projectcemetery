This was a Twitter bot that would search for people mentioning that it was their birthday and then respond with some form of "happy birthday" or "have a nice day". I think I was hoping to offset the negativity of the [StellerSpeller](/projects/stellerspeller) Twitter bot. Anyway, this bot also proved to be troublesome, because apparently tons of people are afraid of clowns... So mentioning that it's your birthday and then immediately receiving a response from a clown is not very high on many people's birthday TODO lists.

Oops.

This bot faded off into the distance as well.
