Imagine the early 2000s. You search for lyrics to your favorite song, and you are presented with terrible lyric website after terrible lyric website. You're close one popup ad and another one takes its place. It's hard to find the lyrics because the banner ads fill half of the page. Oh wait, that's still how it is today?

Anyway, the goal of this site was to collect all of the lyrics for all of the songs and present them in a nice, easy-to-read format. But it never saw the light of day...

It even had a cute lemur mascot too!
