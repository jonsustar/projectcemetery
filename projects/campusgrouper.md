This was my senior project in college. This was long before there were easy-to-use websites that allowed you to create other websites. And so the goal of this website (written in PHP, by the way... yikes) was to allow school or college groups to make and maintain their own website. It had a page for members, where you could add pictures and details about each student, a page for photo albums, a page for events, etc.

This was a great experience, and I haven't touched PHP since! I kept renewing the domain for many years, and I finally let it expire. Other companies have done a way better job with WYSIWYGÂ website editors. But having it memorialized here is nice.
