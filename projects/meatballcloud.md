Remember the book "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"? (Not the movie, the book. Don't get me started on the movie.) Well this was a website that would give you the weather forecast for the day. Specifically, the forecast for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It randomly generated combinations of foods, like "a light drizzle of orange juiceÂ followed by a crouton hail storm", for each forecast.

I launched it as basically a text-only website, and I had hopes to add some more colors and imagery to it. But that proved to be difficult, I never got around to it, and now here we are, a few years later. Rest in peace.
