This started out as a joke that then resulted in me purchasing this domain. And it was a real thing for a bit!

To use the Hipster API, you'd send your request via postcard, and then you'd get a response via postcard. I received two postcards, and I failed in ever sending back a response.

I'm sorry to the two people on this earth that sent postcards. (I believe one was from France!)
