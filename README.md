# Welcome to Project Cemetery

First of all, our condolences to your project. I know you had the best of intentions. Some projects were just meant to never see the light of day.

## Submit your project

You can easily bury your own project to this cemetery. You just need to add a file and create a pull request.

Create the new file by clicking this link: https://github.com/zapstarsolutions/projectcemetery-dev/new/main/projects

Please name the file using only alphanumeric characters and hyphens. The extension should be `.md`.

And then use this template. Only the title and description are required. Copy and paste this when creating that new file.

```

Some further notes on the above fields:
- `live_url`: Only include a URL here if it's truly still working.
- `epitaph`: This is just a short sentence or phrase to memorialize the project. Short enough to fit on a gravestone.
- `contributors`: These are the actual owners/creators/founders of the project or website.
  - `name`: Their name or nickname or username.
  - `github`: Their Github username (without the @ prefix).
  - `twitter`: Their Twitter username (without the @ prefix).
  - `website`: The full URL to their personal or company website, including the `https://`.
